Explanation:

Password Generation:

The generate_password() function generates a random password based on user-selected options such as length, inclusion of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, symbols, and exclusion of specific characters.
It validates the length input and ensures at least one character type is selected.
The generated password is displayed in the password entry field.

Clipboard Integration:

The copy_to_clipboard() function copies the generated password to the clipboard using the pyperclip library.

GUI Design:

Tkinter is used to create a user-friendly interface with labels, checkboxes, and buttons.
The interface allows users to customize the password generation process.

Customization:

You can extend the program by adding more security rules, such as ensuring a mix of character types in the generated password.
Improve the GUI design for better user experience.
Add more customization options, such as defining minimum counts for each character type.
